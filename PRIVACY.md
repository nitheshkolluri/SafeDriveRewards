# SafeDrive Privacy Policy

Your privacy is fundamental to the SafeDrive experience. We are committed to being transparent about the data we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it. This document provides a clear, human-readable overview of our privacy practices.

## What Information We Collect

### 1. Account Information

-   **What:** Your name, email address, and profile settings (e.g., saved places).
-   **Why:** To create and manage your account, personalize your experience, and communicate with you.

### 2. Location & Driving Data

-   **What:** Precise geolocation (latitude, longitude), speed, acceleration, and device orientation data during an active trip.
-   **Why:** This is the core data required to provide our service. We use it to:
    -   Track your route for navigation.
    -   Calculate your trip distance, duration, and points.
    -   Analyze driving events (speeding, harsh braking) to calculate your safety score.
    -   Improve the accuracy of our driving analysis algorithms.

### 3. Application Usage Data

-   **What:** General interaction data, such as which features you use, button clicks, and screen views. This data is anonymized.
-   **Why:** To understand how our users interact with the app, identify areas for improvement, and fix bugs.

## How We Use Your Information

-   **To Provide and Improve the Service:** Your data is essential for the core functionality of the app—tracking trips, rewarding points, and offering navigation.
-   **To Personalize Your Experience:** We use your saved places and trip history to make the app more convenient for you.
-   **To Communicate With You:** We may use your email to send important service updates or information about your account.
-   **For Safety and Security:** We may use information to investigate and prevent fraudulent or unsafe activity.

## Data Sharing & Third Parties

**We do not sell your personal, identifiable data.** Our business model is built on partnerships, not on selling out our users.

-   **Partner Rewards:** When you choose to redeem a reward, we may share a unique, non-identifiable redemption code with that partner to validate your discount. We do not share your name, email, or trip history with reward partners.
-   **Service Providers:** We may use third-party companies to help us operate our service (e.g., cloud hosting providers). These companies are contractually obligated to protect your data and are not permitted to use it for their own purposes.

## Anonymized Data for Analytics

As outlined in our Business Model, we may use **aggregated and anonymized** driving data for analytics and insights. This is a critical point:

-   **Aggregation:** Data is combined from thousands of users.
-   **Anonymization:** All Personally Identifiable Information (PII), such as your user ID, trip start/end points, and exact routes, is completely removed.

The resulting data set might show that "the intersection of 1st and Main St. sees 50% more harsh braking events than the city average," but it can **never** be used to identify that *you* were one of the drivers who braked harshly there. This anonymized data helps us contribute to public safety (e.g., by informing city planning) while rigorously protecting individual privacy.

## Your Control

You are in control of your data.
-   You can access and update your profile information at any time.
-   You can delete your saved places.
-   You can request the deletion of your account and all associated data by contacting our support team.

## Data Security

We implement robust technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. Please see our `SECURITY.md` for detailed information on our security posture.
